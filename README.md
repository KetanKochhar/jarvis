Why I created this 

Jarvis: Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant - Inspired by Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa(name is inspiered by ironman movie)

Introduction:
For my school science exhibition, I created a voice-controlled personal assistant called Jarvis as part of my computer science project. The project aimed to replicate the functionalities of popular virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Jarvis can greet users, perform searches on Wikipedia, open Google, and open YouTube. This project was developed using Python and various libraries.

Features:
1. Greetings: Jarvis greets users based on the current time of day, creating a friendly and personalized experience.

2. Voice Recognition: Using the Speech Recognition library, Jarvis can understand and convert user speech into text.

3. Text-to-Speech Conversion: With the help of the pyttsx3 library, Jarvis can respond to users by converting text into spoken words.

4. Wikipedia Search: Jarvis allows users to search for information on Wikipedia. It uses the Wikipedia library to retrieve concise summaries of search queries.

5. Web Browsing: Jarvis can open Google, allowing users to search the web for any information they need. The webbrowser library is utilized to open the default web browser.

6. YouTube Access: Jarvis provides users with the ability to open YouTube. This feature uses the webbrowser library to launch the YouTube website.

Future Development:
While developing Jarvis for the science exhibition, I realized that there is immense potential for further improvement and expansion. Due to limited knowledge and resources, certain features couldn't be implemented at this stage. However, I am eager to continue working on enhancing the program as I pursue my college studies in computer science. Here are some potential areas for improvement:

1. Background Process: Creating a mechanism for Jarvis to run continuously in the background, waiting for a specific voice command (e.g., "Jarvis"), would make it more convenient and responsive.

2. Expanded Functionality: Adding more features, such as weather updates, news retrieval, email integration, calendar management, and home automation control, would make Jarvis even more versatile and useful.

3. Natural Language Processing: Implementing natural language processing techniques would enable Jarvis to better understand and interpret user commands, making interactions more seamless and intuitive.

Conclusion:
Creating Jarvis as a voice-controlled personal assistant for my school science exhibition was an exciting and rewarding experience. It provided a glimpse into the possibilities of artificial intelligence and voice-activated technologies. While there is room for improvement, this project demonstrates my passion for exploring innovative solutions and my commitment to continue advancing my knowledge and skills in computer science.

How to use this 

Instructions to Run Jarvis.py - Command Line Based Personal Assistant

1)Install Python: Ensure that you have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

2)Install Required Libraries: Open the command prompt and install the necessary Python libraries by executing the following commands:

Copy code
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install wikipedia
pip install webbrowser
pip install subprocess

Download the Jarvis.py File: Download the Jarvis.py file, which contains the complete code for the project, from your preferred source.

Navigate to the File Location: Open the command prompt and use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you have saved the Jarvis.py file.

Run the Program: In the command prompt, enter the command python Jarvis.py and press Enter to run the program.

Interacting with Jarvis: Once the program is running, you can interact with Jarvis using voice commands. The following commands are supported:

"Open browser": Launches the default web browser.
"Search Wikipedia": Performs a search on Wikipedia and provides a summary of the search query.
"Open YouTube": Opens the YouTube website.
Exiting the Program: To close the program, you can either say "Stop" as a voice command or press Ctrl+C in the command prompt to stop the Python program.


Please note that this project is a small endeavor and may not match the full capabilities of Google Assistant. However, with consistent effort and ongoing improvements, I can create a personal assistant that surpasses the capabilities of existing virtual assistants.
